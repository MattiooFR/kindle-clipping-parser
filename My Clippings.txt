However, if you practice elaboration, there’s no known limit to how much you can learn. Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later.

Almost everywhere you look, you find examples of massed practice: summer language boot camps, colleges that offer concentration in a single subject with the promise of fast learning, continuing education seminars for professionals where training is condensed into a single weekend. Cramming for exams is a form of massed practice. It feels like a productive strategy, and it may get you through the next day’s midterm, but most of the material will be long forgotten by the time you sit down for the final. Spacing out your practice feels less productive for the very reason that some forgetting has set in and you’ve got to work harder to recall the concepts. It doesn’t feel like you’re on top of it. What you don’t sense in the moment is that this added effort is making the learning stronger.2 Spaced Practice The benefits of spacing out practice sessions are long established, but for a vivid example consider this study of thirty-eight surgical residents. They took a series of four short lessons in microsurgery: how to reattach tiny vessels. Each lesson included some instruction followed by some practice. Half the docs completed all four lessons in a single day, which is the normal in-service schedule. The others completed the same four lessons but with a week’s interval between them.3 In a test given a month after their last session, those whose lessons had been spaced a week apart outperformed their colleagues in all areas—elapsed time to complete a surgery, number of hand movements, and success at reattaching the severed, pulsating aortas of live rats. The difference in performance between the two groups was impressive. The residents who had taken all four sessions in a single day not only scored lower on all measures, but 16 percent of them damaged the rats’ vessels beyond repair and were unable to complete their surgeries. Why is spaced practice more effective than massed practice? It appears that embedding new learning in long-term memory requires a process of consolidation, in which memory traces (the brain’s representations of the new learning) are strengthened, given meaning, and connected to prior knowledge—a process that unfolds over hours and may take several days. Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory. Durable learning,

One form of practice that helps us learn from experience, as the neurosurgeon Mike Ebersold recounted in Chapter 2, is reflection. Some people are more given to the act of reflection than others, so Doug Larsen has broadened his research to study how you might structure reflection as an integral part of the training, helping students cultivate it as a habit. He is experimenting with requiring students to write daily or weekly summaries of what they did, how it worked, and what they might do differently next time to get better results. He speculates that daily reflection, as a form of spaced retrieval practice, is probably just as critical in the real-world application of medicine as quizzing and testing are in building competencies in medical school.

How big an interval, you ask? The simple answer: enough so that practice doesn’t become a mindless repetition. At a minimum, enough time so that a little forgetting has set in. A little forgetting between practice sessions can be a good thing, if it leads to more effort in practice, but you do not want so much forgetting that retrieval essentially involves relearning the material. The time periods between sessions of practice let memories consolidate. Sleep seems to play a large role in memory consolidation, so practice with at least a day in between sessions is good.

Beware of the familiarity trap: the feeling that you know something and no longer need to practice it. This familiarity can hurt you during self-quizzing if you take shortcuts. Doug Larsen says, “You have to be disciplined to say, ‘All right, I’m going to make myself recall all of this and if I don’t, what did I miss, how did I not know that?’ Whereas if you have an instructor-generated test or quiz, suddenly you have to do it, there’s an expectation, you can’t cheat, you can’t take mental shortcuts around it, you simply have to do that.” The nine quizzes Andy Sobel administers over the twenty-six meetings of his political economics course are a simple example of spaced retrieval practice, and of interleaving—because he rolls forward into each successive quiz questions pertaining to work from the beginning of the semester. Interleaving two or more subjects during practice also provides a form of spacing. Interleaving can also help you develop your ability to discriminate later between different kinds of problems and select the right tool from your growing toolkit of solutions. In interleaving, you don’t move from a complete practice set of one topic to go to another. You switch before each practice is complete. A friend of ours describes his own experience with this: “I go to a hockey class and we’re learning skating skills, puck handling, shooting, and I notice that I get frustrated because we do a little bit of skating and just when I think I’m getting it, we go to stick handling, and I go home frustrated, saying, ‘Why doesn’t this guy keep letting us do these things until we get it?’ ” This is actually the rare coach who understands

The process of strengthening these mental representations for long-term memory is called consolidation. New learning is labile: its meaning is not fully formed and therefore is easily altered. In consolidation, the brain reorganizes and stabilizes the memory traces. This may occur over several hours or longer and involves deep processing of the new material, during which scientists believe that the brain replays or rehearses the learning, giving it meaning, filling in blank spots, and making connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Prior knowledge is a prerequisite for making sense of new learning, and forming those connections is an important task of consolidation.

In fact, because new learning depends on prior learning, the more we learn, the more possible connections we create for further learning. Our retrieval capacity, though, is severely limited. Most of what we’ve learned is not accessible to us at any given moment. This limitation on retrieval is helpful to us: if every memory were always readily to hand, you would have a hard time sorting through the sheer volume of material to put your finger on the knowledge you need at the moment: where did I put my hat, how do I sync my electronic devices, what goes into a perfect brandy Manhattan?

Knowledge that is well entrenched, like real fluency in French or years of experience driving on the right side of the road, is easily relearned later, after a period of disuse or after being interrupted by competition for retrieval cues. It’s not the knowledge itself that has been forgotten, but the cues that enable you to find and retrieve it. The cues for the new learning, driving on the left, displace those for the old, driving on the right (if we are lucky). The paradox is that some forgetting is often essential for new learning.6 When you change from a PC to a Mac, or from one Windows platform to another, you have to do enormous forgetting in order to learn the architecture of the new system and become adept at manipulating it so readily that your attention can focus on doing your work and not on working the machine. Jump school training provides another example: After their military service, many paratroopers take an interest in smoke jumping. Smokejumpers use different airplanes, different equipment, and different jump protocols. Having trained at the army’s jump school is cited as a distinct disadvantage for smoke jumping, because you have to unlearn one set of procedures that you have practiced to the point of reflex and replace them with another. Even in cases where both bodies of learning seem so similar to the uninitiated—jumping out of an airplane with a parachute on your back—you may have to forget the cues to a complex body of learning that you possess if you are to acquire a new one. We know this problem of reassigning cues to memory from our own lives, even on the simplest levels.

Massed practice gives us the warm sensation of mastery because we’re looping information through short-term memory without having to reconstruct the learning from long-term memory. But just as with rereading as a study strategy, the fluency gained through massed practice is transitory, and our sense of mastery is illusory. It’s the effortful process of reconstructing the knowledge that triggers reconsolidation and deeper learning.

Learning is at least a three-step process: initial encoding of information is held in short-term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory. Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory.

I’ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don’t fully get it, it’s like a tree in your head with no trunk—and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic—a new branch or leaf of the tree—there’s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about.

Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because they’re the remains of ancient living things. “Ancient” in this case spans a wide range. The earliest organisms that contribute to today’s fossil fuels lived during the Precambrian Eon, before there were any plants and animals on land—the fossil organisms then would have been ocean algae. People often think fossil fuels are made of dinosaurs, but any dinosaurs in our gasoline are from the last couple hundred million years—the later stretch of the timespan—and only a small contributor. The largest portion of our fossil fuels comes from plants, animals, and algae that lived during the Carboniferous Period—a 50 million year period that ended about 300 million years ago and during which there were lots of huge, shallow swamps. The swamps were important because it made it more likely that a dead organism would be preserved. You don’t become a fossil fuel if you die in a normal place and decompose away. But by dying in a swamp and sinking to the bottom, Carboniferous organisms often ended up being quickly covered by sand and clay and were able to make it underground with their joules still intact.

To put it another way, photosynthesis just kidnaps carbon and sun energy out of the atmosphere, and after years of holding them hostage, combustion sets them both free—the carbon as a billowing eruption of newly reunited CO2, and the sun energy as fire—meaning that fire is essentially just tightly packed sunshine.

The familiarity with a text that is gained from rereading creates illusions of knowing, but these are not reliable indicators of mastery of the material.

If you use self-quizzing as your primary study strategy and space out your study sessions so that a little forgetting has happened since your last practice, you will have to work harder to reconstruct what you already studied. In effect, you’re “reloading” it from long-term memory. This effort to reconstruct the learning makes the important ideas more salient and memorable and connects them more securely to other knowledge and to more recent learning.

He became more mindful of that when he studied. “I would stop. ‘Okay, what did I just read? What is this about?’ I’d have to think about it. ‘Well, I believe it happens this way: The enzyme does this, and then it does that.’ And then I’d have to go back and check if I was way off base or on the right track.” The process was not a natural fit. “It makes you uncomfortable at first. If you stop and rehearse what you’re reading and quiz yourself on it, it just takes a lot longer. If you have a test coming up in a week and so much to cover, slowing down makes you pretty nervous.” But the only way he knew of to cover more material, his established habit of dedicating long hours to rereading, wasn’t getting the results he needed. As hard as it was, he made himself stick to retrieval practice long enough at least to see if it worked. “You just have to trust the process, and that was really the biggest hurdle for me, was to get myself to trust it. And it ended up working out really well for me.”

The chef says, “Ugh okay, here we go,” rolls up his sleeves, and does what he always does in these situations—he switches on the active decision-making part of his software and starts to go to work. He looks at what data he has and seeks out what more he needs. He thinks about the current state of the world and reflects on where his values and priorities lie. He gathers together those relevant first principles ingredients and starts puzzling together a reasoning pathway. It takes some hard work, but eventually, the pathway brings him to a hypothesis. He knows it’s probably wrong-ish, and as new data emerges, he’ll “taste-test” the hypothesis and adjust it. He keeps the decision-making center on standby for the next few weeks as he makes a bunch of early adjustments to the flawed hypothesis—a little more salt, a little less sugar, one prime ingredient that needs to be swapped out for another. Eventually, he’s satisfied enough with how things are going to move back into auto-pilot mode. This new decision is now part of the automated routine—a new recipe is in the cookbook—and he’ll check in on it to make adjustments every once in a while or as new pertinent data comes in, the way he does for all parts of his software.

And if thinking about all of that ends with you drowning in some combination of self-doubt, self-loathing, and identity crisis, that’s perfect. This first epiphany is about humility. Humility is by definition a starting point—and it sends you off on a journey from there. The arrogance of certainty is both a starting point and an ending point—no journeys needed. That’s why it’s so important that we begin with “I don’t know shit.” That’s when we know we’re in the lab.

It’s for this reason that Steve Jobs looks back on his firing from Apple in 1986 as a blessing in disguise. He said:14 “Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Being fired “freed” Jobs from the shackles of his own history.

The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own fear. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by defying it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you’ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain’s ingrained, irrational fears.

Ç'aurait pu être Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon... la chance voulut que ce fût aux Seychelles que l'Armement envoya Gauvain en voyage d'études, envisageant d'y baser quelques thoniers concarnois. Cet alibi professionnel lui permit de se masquer la réalité, à savoir qu'il soustrayait huit jours à sa chère famille pour tenter de revivre l'incompréhensible chose – il n'osait pas l'appeler Amour - qui l'avait déjà bouleversé à deux reprises. Et, plus inimaginable encore, une femme faisait dix mille kilomètres sans autre raison que son désir de faire l'amour avec lui. Oui, lui, Lozerech! On lui aurait dit ça... Et en fait depuis qu'il était arrivé aux Seychelles dix jours plus tôt, il hésitait entre

Il était une fois dans un archipel de l'océan Indien, par le plus grand des hasards - ou était-ce la plus impérieuse des nécessités ? – un marin et une historienne que rien ne prédisposait à se retrouver ensemble, l'un et l'autre habités par un désir si physique qu'ils n'osaient le nommer amour; l'un et l'autre incrédules devant cette attirance et s'attendant chaque matin à retrouver raison; l'un et l'autre enfin s'interrogeant sur ce qui leur

Cette montagne d'absence entre eux commence à fondre mais Gauvain n'ose pas encore écraser cette femme à côté de lui sur sa poitrine et l'emporter pour l'embrocher. Et cette femme n'ose pas poser ses lèvres dans l'échancrure de l'infâme chemisette, sur la fourrure douce de sa poitrine, ni promener ses mains sur les hanches étroites qui l'émeuvent toujours dans ce corps si fort. Ils se tiennent côte à côte, écoutant monter cette marée où ils aspirent à se noyer. Déjà ils flottent et leurs jambes ne les portent plus.

Alex Malarkey a été victime d’un grave accident de voiture 18 quand il avait 6 ans, en 2004. Il se réveille après 2 mois passés dans le coma et dit avoir vu des anges, et même avoir discuté avec Jésus. En 2010, son père a fait de l’histoire un bestseller (plus de 8 millions d’exemplaires vendus). Mais plus tard les parents divorcent, on entend parler d’histoires d’argent et le jeune homme annonce en 2015 que toute l’histoire était fausse. Il avait menti pour qu’on s’intéresse à lui, et tout lui avait échappé, récupéré par des gens qui voulaient y croire et qui avaient du papier à vendre. Si ce témoignage-là, diffusé à grande échelle, s’est révélé faux, quel critère pourrait nous permettre de distinguer la vérité du mensonge sur des expériences qui sont, par défnition, subjectives ? Il n’y en a pas. C’est pourquoi un témoignage n’est jamais une preuve scientifque de la réalité d’un phénomène.

. Le cas Eben Alexander Le docteur Eben Alexander est un neurochirurgien, a priori sceptique, selon ses dires. Il contracte une méningite bacté- rienne en 2008, tombe dans le coma et vit une EMI très marquante avec force détails qu'il rapporte ensuite : des jardins, des paysages, des sentiments, une jolie flle sur une aile de papillon qu'il reconnaîtra ensuite comme la sœur biologique décédée qu'il n'a jamais rencontrée, la présence de Dieu… La spécifcité de ce cas est que le Dr Alexander affrme, du haut de son autorité de neurologue, que la maladie avait tellement endommagé son cerveau qu'il est impossible que son EMI soit le produit de l'activité de cet organe ; ces événements ont donc dû se produire ailleurs, en dehors de son corps. C'est un récit tout à fait saisissant, relaté dans un best-seller «La Preuve du Paradis» publié en 2012, et qui vaut à son auteur de donner des

LA MÉDECINE BASÉE SUR LES PREUVES (« EVIDENCE BASED MEDECINE ») Soulever la question de l’effcacité de la prière comme méthode thérapeutique revient à se poser la question de savoir comment évaluer un traitement médical, quel qu’il soit. Est-il dangereux ? Amène-t-il la guérison ? Dans quelles conditions ? De tout temps, les personnes engagées dans cette quête de la guérison se sont posées ces questions. La manière d’y répondre de façon claire remonte au 18ème siècle. Deux exemples historiques3 illustrent magnifquement la démarche à suivre pour évaluer une méthode thérapeutique. Transportons

À son bord, un marin sur dix commence à souffrir du scorbut, maladie faisant des ravages sur tous les navires du monde et causant la mort de dizaines de milliers de marins.

Le 20 mai, il décide de sélectionner douze marins ayant des symptômes identiques. Il les regroupe dans la même partie du navire et les soumet au même régime alimentaire. Ensuite, il les associe par paires et apporte, chaque jour, à chacune d’entre elles, un traitement différent : un quart de cidre, quelques gouttes d’élixir de vitriol (acide sulfurique), deux cuillères de vinaigre, une demie pinte d’eau de mer, une mixture à base de racines de radis et de moutarde et enfn deux oranges et un citron par jour. Il ne lui reste plus qu’à attendre afn d’observer l’évolution de la maladie. L’essai était censé durer quatorze jours mais fut stoppé après six jours car la réserve de fruits s’était épuisée. Cette fn anticipée n’a en aucune manière perturbé le test tant le résultat était déjà remarquable. Les deux marins prenant les oranges et le citron avaient recouvré tous leurs moyens à tel point qu’ils aidaient même l’équipage pour les soins de leurs compagnons moins chanceux. James Lind venait de procéder au premier essai clinique.

Réelle manifestation de la volonté divine ou mystifcation ? Des sceptiques américains, au premier rang desquels on trouve James Randi, ont tenté de faire la lumière sur tous ces cas de guérisons spontanées et spectaculaires. La réalité fut alors beaucoup moins réjouissante. De tous les cas de guérisons sur lesquels ils ont enquêté, aucun n’a pu être confrmé. Soit le guérisseur ne voulait pas répondre aux demandes d’informations, soit il répondait mais ne voulait pas fournir le dossier médical du patient. Quand le dossier médical pouvait être consulté, il s’avérait que le malade ne souffrait pas de la maladie pour laquelle il avait, soi-disant, été guéri. Il est, en effet, plus facile de guérir lorsque l’on n’est pas malade ! Des « paralytiques » qui se sont levés de leur fauteuil roulant pouvaient, en réalité, très bien marcher avant la cérémonie. Plus sordide, des malades pris dans l’ambiance du moment se sont crus guéris mais, quelques jours après, la triste réalité de leur maladie les a rattrapés

Galton a attiré l’attention sur le fait que la santé de la famille royale est au centre des prières effectuées chaque jour dans toutes les églises anglicanes d’Angleterre et que, par conséquent, leur durée de vie devait être plus longue que celle des autres classes sociales (leur santé étant améliorée par l’action de la prière). En comparant la longévité de la famille royale à celle des autres classes, il constate qu’il n’y a pas de différence signifcative. Deux solutions s’offrent à lui : soit la prière a un effet, mais dans ce cas cela veut dire que la famille royale - au centre des prières de leurs sujets - a une espérance de vie inférieure aux

As Stanley Milgram has observed, in our everyday lives we often make inferences and construct narratives about strangers on the basis of very little information.3 For example, most of us come in regular contact with “familiar strangers”—people we see in the elevator each morning or in the grocery store or dropping the kids off at school. Our “relationship” with such people is a subtle one. We are aware of each other’s presence, but we collude to remain strangers. It is a frozen relationship.

When asked to list their attributes, HSMs tend to report more publicly visible or available aspects of themselves such as physical features, status, and roles they play. LSMs are more likely to report their internal attributes such as their values, enduring preferences, or the kind of traits subsumed by the Big Five factors. When researchers examine these self-concepts it appears that the HSMs are rather like onions—one keeps peeling back layer after layer until one discovers no substantial self there at all.9

So with which of these alternative selves were you falling in love? Isn’t it risky to commit to one whose self is so mutable? But the HSM also expresses grounds for frustration. Can’t your romantic partner simply go with the flow of the situation and flex a bit instead of alienating two-thirds of your family? Might he actually be, as others have hinted, a self-focused and insensitive jerk?

The advantages of being an HSM include a suppleness and agility that increases success in getting along and getting ahead in life. But the downside of being an HSM is that it can foster a lack of commitment to partners and organizations, a sense of self-fragmentation, and a reputation for being all things to all people.

Maybe internal individuals are simply rigid and become defiant when they are pushed to change their minds. But the evidence suggests that this is not the case. For example, whereas the prestige of someone attempting to influence them is more likely to influence externals, internals are more sensitive to the content of a message and will change if a compelling case is made to them.

They are prone to interrupting others who, in their opinion, speak too slowly.

Check off any of the following adjectives that you believe accurately describe you:   affected   capable   cautious   clever   commonplace   confident   conservative   conventional   dissatisfied   egotistical   honest   humorous   individualistic   informal   insightful   intelligent   interests narrow   interests wide   inventive   mannerly   original   reflective   resourceful   self-confident   sexy   sincere   snobbish   submissive   suspicious   unconventional This scale was developed by Harrison Gough of the University of California, Berkeley, and has been used extensively for research purposes as a brief, valid measure of creative personality.2 To obtain your score, add up the total number of checks you gave for the items capable, clever, confident, egotistical, humorous, individualistic, informal, insightful, intelligent, interests wide, inventive, original, reflective, resourceful, self-confident, sexy, snobbish, and unconventional. Now subtract from this total your number of checks on the items affected, cautious, conservative, conventional, dissatisfied, honest, interests narrow, mannerly, sincere, submissive, and suspicious. The theoretical range of scores is therefore from –12 to +18. Scores of 10 or more are similar to those of highly creative individuals.

one student eventually tried the daring deed, and the buzz back at the lab was “They’re getting up!” But the assistant was finding it extremely stressful. Milgram then decided to find out for himself. He reported entering the subway, approaching a person, and almost choking on the request for the seat. He said he literally felt sick. What’s going on here? The norm of noninvolvement is very powerful and so deeply internalized that flouting it extracts a toll.

For Alexander, cities enhance feelings of personal agency and isolation and should be radically redesigned to stimulate more human connection and intimate contact. For Milgram, cities have too much human contact, and such exposure leads to overload and the adaptive strategies that mitigate its negative effects.

“Okay, Jennifer, I want you to get some spit in your mouth.” I demonstrated with exaggerated mouth movements, which they somehow found funny, and she followed by making her own good wad. “Now, swallow it.” Jennifer complied, looking rather confused. I then asked her whether it felt strange or uncomfortable, and she responded that it didn’t. Apparently she had swallowed on previous occasions. So far this was profoundly uninteresting, and I barely glanced at my daughter, who was showing incipient signs of mortification. But then I took out a sparkling clean glass, placed it in front of Jennifer, and asked her once again to get some spit in her mouth. She did. “Now spit into the glass.” She did. “Now drink it.” Gross! No way! They

The language we use when we are discussing our personal projects is an important determinant of whether they are likely to be successfully pursued. In a brilliant analysis of the linguistic features of personal project phrasing, Neil Chambers demonstrated that the way we phrase our pursuits has important consequences for how they will turn out as well as for our overall well-being.6 He shows convincingly that personal projects phrased as direct action, such as “Lose ten pounds,” are more likely to be successful and associated with higher levels of well-being than are those that are phrased more tentatively, such as “Try to lose weight.” Indeed, Chambers suggests that “trying personalities,” who are at risk for lowered well-being, should be encouraged to reformulate their projects as active doings. Don’t think about possibly doing it. Don’t just try to do it—just do it!

The most frequently listed projects are interpersonal projects, work (or school) projects, health projects, and recreational projects. Although less frequent in number, what we call “intrapersonal” projects (e.g., “Be more outgoing,” “Get control of my temper”) are of particular interest. These are projects that are concerned with attempts to understand and change one’s self. As we shall see later, such personal projects have an intriguing and somewhat paradoxical relation with our well-being. To understand this, we need to know not just what

It seems counterintuitive to claim that the pursuit of projects like “Take out the garbage,” “Pick up the mail,” and “Buy some toothpaste” would be more conducive to well-being than “Grow as a person” or “Transform Western thought.” So what is going on here? The best answer, I believe, is that well-being is enhanced when both efficacy and meaning are experienced within the same projects. In other words, mere efficacy is insufficient.11

Let’s assume then that your personal projects are meaningful, manageable, socially connected, and involve a higher ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. Our research provides ample evidence that if your life is filled with such projects, you are likely to be happy and that, for you, life is good. And what if the opposite is the case? What if your days are played out in projects that have no significance, are chaotic, are isolated from the recognition and support of others, and are unremittingly painful emotionally? What then? Unlike factors we have treated earlier in the book, such as relatively fixed traits and constraining environments, personal projects are tractable—we can change them. Whereas traits are something we have, projects are something we do. Whereas contexts embed us, projects pull us forward into new possibilities. And one of those possibilities is a better life and a happier life.

How can you tell which of your personal projects are truly core projects? There are several ways of assessing this. First, we can identify those projects that you rate as most meaningful to you, on bases such as their importance, their consistency with your values, and whether they are self-expressive for you. Those projects that are meaningful in each of these different aspects can be regarded as core projects. Another way of looking at core projects is to determine how each of your projects relates to the other projects that you are currently pursuing—in other words, by looking at your personal project system as a whole.

Abandoning a core project would entail a major shift in the rest of the commitments and undertakings of your life. Resistance to abandoning core projects also means that you are not easily swayed by competing projects or alternative opportunities that knock on your door late on a Wednesday afternoon. But resistance can take a toll as well, particularly if a core project is pursued with grim resolve despite having lost its motivational force and its viability. Under such conditions the project becomes unsustainable, and your quality of life becomes compromised.

One reason is a tendency for such projects to become ruminative concerns, but another reason is that self-projects are also typically rated as low on efficacy—we doubt they will be successfully completed. Because a belief that our projects will succeed is a key aspect of well-being, we might be tempted to encourage ourselves and others to “get over yourself” and focus on more promising pursuits. But we should be cautious with such admonishments. Self-projects also have interesting links with creativity. More creative individuals are likely to identify with their self-projects and construe them as being exploratory ventures rather than depressing burdens.12

Instead of being the conscientious, careful, traditional one, they become the exploratory, norm-bucking, and potentially more rebellious sibling.

We talked about the personal constructs that can frame our experience but create cages out of which we need to escape. We explored the links between our relatively stable traits and important life outcomes and also how we can engage in free traits in order to advance what matters most to us in our lives. We saw how a sense of agency in our lives has positive consequences but only if accompanied by alertness to the realities of our environments. We cautioned that an overzealous lifestyle could be dangerous to our health unless mitigated by a sense of play. We examined how the situational demands of our lives shape self-presentation for some people but not for others. We observed how creativity requires audacious imagination and commitment but also an awareness of others’ unacknowledged contributions. We surveyed how geography and personality are intertwined and how certain personalities are drawn to certain cities and regions. We considered the importance of how personal projects, especially core projects, provide our lives with a sense of meaning and structure, connection and emotional richness. And we saw how such projects can lose meaning, go stale, and then be revitalized. It remains for us to stand back a bit and ask you how you are doing. Have you been reflecting on your own life as you have gone through the chapters? You have likely had and will in the future have other occasions on which to reflect on your personality and how your life has gone. Such moments of reflection often occur at major transition points in our lives. A graduation, a marriage, a divorce, a promotion, a job loss, a retirement—all of these call for some reflection on how we are doing, where we are going, and how to proceed. They are linked to different stages of the life cycle and are expectable, if not always desired, occurrences in modern life. Other calls for reflection are subtler. You have a quiet conversation with a friend who asks how you are really doing, and you are taken aback that you hesitated so long before answering. A friend dies, you are asked to give a eulogy, and it brings you to tears, but not only because you are grieving: you kept seeing yourself in the sentences you were reading about him. You have had a sleepless night cursing that infuriating dragon who messed up the meeting this morning—just who did she think she was?—and then conceding that she was, in fact, you. How can you reconcile these two different selves at two in the morning?15 In these reflections you may have seen that you and yourself play somewhat different roles. You construe yourself through personal constructs, and the self you construe might be closed and afraid to venture out. Or you act out of character and leave your comfortable self behind. Or you find yourself in a situation that has such a powerful and unwanted influence on you that you really weren’t yourself at all. Perhaps you have lost yourself in a core project that made you transform your sense of who you truly were, creating a new self in the process. Each of these transactions between you and yourself can be illuminating, but they can also be challenging—you and your self may need some reconciliation.16 Owen

A 2014 study published in Science asked participants to sit in a room and think for fifteen minutes. The room was empty except for a device that allowed the participants to mildly but painfully electrocute themselves. “Why would anyone want to do that?” you might ask. When asked beforehand, every participant in the study said they would pay to avoid being shocked. However, when left alone in the room with the machine and nothing else to do, 67 percent of men and 25 percent of women shocked themselves, and many did so multiple times. The study’s authors conclude their paper by saying, “People prefer doing to thinking, even if what they are doing is so unpleasant that they would normally pay to avoid it. The untutored mind does not like to be alone with itself.”

The third factor is rumination, our tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences. If you’ve ever chewed over something in your mind that you did, or that someone did to you, or over something that you don’t have but wanted, over and over again, seemingly unable to stop thinking about it, you’ve experienced what psychologists call rumination. This “passive comparison of one’s current situation with some unachieved standard” can manifest in self-critical thoughts such as, “Why can’t I handle things better?”

When the flight attendants flying to New York were above the Atlantic Ocean, they reported weak cravings. Meanwhile, at the exact same moment, the cravings of their colleagues who had just landed in Europe were at their strongest. What was going on? The New York–bound flight attendants knew they could not smoke in the middle of a flight without being fired. Only later, when they approached their destination, did they report the greatest desire to smoke. It appeared the duration of the trip and the time since their last cigarette didn’t affect the level of the flight attendants’ cravings. What affected their desire was not how much time had passed after a smoke, but how much time was left before they could smoke again.

Liminal moments are transitions from one thing to another throughout our days. Have you ever picked up your phone while waiting for a traffic light to change, then found yourself still looking at your phone while driving? Or opened a tab in your web browser, got annoyed by how long it’s taking to load, and opened up another page while you waited? Or looked at a social media app while walking from one meeting to the next, only to keep scrolling when you got back to your desk? There’s nothing wrong with any of these actions per se. Rather, what’s dangerous is that by doing them “for just a second,” we’re likely to do things we later regret, like getting off track for half an hour or getting into a car accident.

A technique I’ve found particularly helpful for dealing with this distraction trap is the “ten-minute rule.” If I find myself wanting to check my phone as a pacification device when I can’t think of anything better to do, I tell myself it’s fine to give in, but not right now. I have to wait just ten minutes. This technique is effective at helping me deal with all sorts of potential distractions, like googling something rather than writing, eating something unhealthy when I’m bored, or watching another episode on Netflix when I’m “too tired to go to bed.” This rule allows time to do what some behavioral psychologists call “surfing the urge.” When an urge takes hold, noticing the sensations and riding them like a wave—neither pushing them away nor acting on them—helps us cope until the feelings subside. Surfing the urge, along with other techniques to bring attention to the craving, has been shown to reduce the number of cigarettes smokers consumed when compared to those in a control group who didn’t use the technique. If we still want to perform the action after ten minutes of urge surfing, we’re free to do it, but that’s rarely still the case. The liminal moment has passed, and we’re able to do the thing

A 2015 review of seventy-nine studies looking at the responses of over sixteen thousand volunteers found that people who have “a positive and caring attitude . . . toward her- or himself in the face of failures and individual shortcomings” tend to be happier. Another study found that people’s tendency to self-blame, along with how much they ruminated on a problem, could almost completely mediate the most common factors associated with depression and anxiety.

The people we love most should not be content getting whatever time is left over. Everyone benefits when we hold time on our schedule to live up to our values and do our share. This domain extends beyond just family. Not scheduling time for the important relationships in our lives is more harmful than most people realize. Recent studies have shown that a dearth of social interaction not only leads to loneliness but is also linked to a range of harmful physical effects. In fact, a lack of close friendships may be hazardous to your health. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that friendships affect longevity comes from the ongoing Harvard Study of Adult Development. Since 1938, researchers have been following the physical health and social habits of 724 men. Robert Waldinger, the study’s current director, said in a TEDx talk, “The clearest message that we get from this seventy-five-year study is this: good relationships keep us happier and healthier.

For our gathering, four couples, my wife and me included, meet every two weeks to talk about one question over a picnic lunch. The question might range from a deep inquiry like, “What is one thing you are thankful your parents taught you?” to a more practical question like, “Should we push our kids to learn things they don’t want, like playing the piano?” Having a topic helps in two ways: first, it gets us past the small talk of sports and weather, giving us an opportunity to open up about stuff that really matters; second, it prevents the gender split that often happens when couples convene in groups—men in one corner, women in another. Having a question of the day gets us all talking together.

Motivation is “the energy for action,” according to Edward Deci, professor of psychology at the University of Rochester. When we’re highly motivated, we have a strong desire, and the requisite energy, to take an action, and when we’re not motivated, we lack the energy to perform a task. Meanwhile, in Fogg’s formula, ability relates to facility of action. Quite simply, the harder something is to do, the less likely people are to do it. Conversely, the easier something is to do, the more likely we are to do it. When people have sufficient motivation and ability, they’re primed for certain behavior. However, without the critical third component, the behavior will not occur. A trigger to tell us what to do next is always required. We discussed internal triggers in a previous section, but when it comes to the products we use every day and the interruptions that lead to distraction, external triggers—stimuli in our environment that prompt us to act—play a big role.

Skinner famously discovered, pigeons pecked at levers more often when given a reward on a variable schedule of reinforcement. Similarly, email’s uncertainty keeps us checking and pecking.

STEP 1: REMOVE The first step to managing distraction on our phones is to remove the apps we no longer need. To do so, I had to ask myself the critical question of which external triggers on my phone were serving me and which were not. Based on my answers, I uninstalled apps that didn’t align with my values. I kept apps for learning and staying healthy and removed news apps with blaring alerts and stress-inducing headlines.

The problem was, I often found myself checking YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter on my phone when I’d planned to spend time with my daughter. When I’d feel a tinge of boredom, I’d watch a short video or give a social network a quick pull-to-refresh. Unfortunately, this also pulled me out of the moment with my daughter. But abandoning these services entirely wasn’t an option for me; I still wanted to use them to keep in touch with friends and watch interesting videos. I found my solution by replacing when and where I used the problematic services. Since I’d set aside time for social media in my timeboxed schedule, there was no longer any need to have them on my phone. After a few minutes of hesitation, removing them from my phone felt like a breath of fresh air. I could breathe easy knowing I could still access these services on my computer and at a time I set aside, not whenever the app maker decided to ping me.

STEP 3: REARRANGE Now that we are left only with our critical mobile apps, it’s time to make our phones less cluttered and, consequently, less distracting. The aim is that nothing on our phones is able to pull us away from traction when we unlock our devices. Tony Stubblebine, editor in chief of the popular Medium publication Better Humans, calls his phone’s setup the “Essential Home Screen.” Stubblebine was the sixth employee at Twitter and is fully aware of the way its platform was designed with human psychology in mind. Stubblebine recommends sorting your apps into three categories: “Primary Tools,” “Aspirations,” and “Slot Machines.” He says Primary Tools “help you accomplish defined tasks that you rely on frequently: getting a ride, finding a location, adding an appointment.

Stubblebine recommends sorting your apps into three categories: “Primary Tools,” “Aspirations,” and “Slot Machines.” He says Primary Tools “help you accomplish defined tasks that you rely on frequently: getting a ride, finding a location, adding an appointment. There should be no more than five or six.” He calls Aspirations “the things you want to spend time doing: meditation, yoga, exercise, reading books, or listening to podcasts.” Stubblebine describes Slot Machines as “the apps that you open and get lost in: email, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.” He recommends rearranging your phone’s home screen so it only displays your Primary Tools and your Aspirations. He instructs you to “think of your home page as a group of apps that you feel you are in charge of. If the app triggers any mindless checking from you, move it to a different screen.”

In addition, instead of swiping from screen to screen to locate an app you need, I recommend using the phone’s built-in search function. This will reduce the risk of bumping into a distracting app if you begin sifting through all your phone’s screens and app folders.

As you can imagine, as a writer, I use the web for research every day. However, whenever I discover a new article, I no longer read it in my web browser right away. Instead, I’ve time-shifted when and how I read online, thereby removing the temptation to read for longer than I intend. Here’s how: I started by installing an app called Pocket on my phone, along with its browser extension on my laptop. In order to abide by my “never read articles in my browser” rule, I simply click the Pocket button in my browser every time I see an article I’d like to read. Pocket then pulls the text from the web page and saves it (without ads and any other superfluous content) to the app on my phone. I replaced my old habit of either reading online content immediately or letting it clog up my web browser with the new habit of saving the articles for consumption at a later time. With this new behavior, my temptation to digest the content wasn’t thwarted; I was just as satisfied knowing that the content was safe and sound, waiting for me until later.

After six months, 6 percent of people in the control group had stopped smoking. The next group, called the “reward group,” was offered $800 if they had stopped smoking after six months—17 percent of them were successful. However, the third group of participants provided the most interesting results. In this group, called the “deposit group,” participants were required to make a precommitment deposit of $150 of their own money with a pledge to be smoke-free after six months. If, and only if, they reached their goal, they would receive the $150 deposit back. In addition to recouping their cash, successful deposit-group participants would also receive a $650 bonus prize (as opposed to the $800 offered to the “reward” participants) from their employer. The results? Of those who accepted the deposit challenge, an astounding 52 percent succeeded in meeting their goal! One would imagine that a greater reward ought to lead to greater motivation to succeed, so why would winning the $800 reward be less effective than winning the $650 reward, plus $150 deposit? Perhaps participants in the deposit group were more motivated to quit smoking in the first place?

Teaching others solidifies your commitment, even if you’re still struggling. A great way to be indistractable is to tell friends about what you learned in this book and the changes you’re making in your life. •    Adopt rituals.

When kids act in ways we don’t like, parents desperately ask, “Why is my kid acting this way?” There’s certainty in a scapegoat, and we often cling to simple answers because they serve a story we want to believe—that kids do strange things because of something outside our control, which means that those behaviors are not really their (or our) fault. Of course, technology plays a role. Smartphone apps and video games are designed to be engaging, just as sugar is meant to be delicious. But like the parents who blame a “sugar high” for their kid’s bad behavior, blaming devices is a surface-level answer to a deep question.

•    Internal triggers drive behavior. To understand how to help kids manage distraction, we need to start by understanding the source of the problem. •    Our kids need psychological nutrients. According to a widely accepted theory of human motivation, all people need three things to thrive: a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. •    Distractions satisfy deficiencies. When our kids’ psychological needs are not met in the real world, they go looking for satisfaction—often in virtual environments. •    Kids need alternatives. Parents and guardians can take steps to help kids find balance between their online and offline worlds by providing more offline opportunities to find autonomy, competence, and relatedness. •    The four-part Indistractable Model is valuable for kids as well.

A good measure of a child’s readiness is the ability to manage distraction by using the settings on the device to turn off external triggers. •    Kids need sleep. There is little justification for having a television or other potential distractions in a kid’s room overnight. Make sure nothing gets in the way of them getting good rest. •    Don’t be the unwanted external trigger. Respect their time and don’t interrupt them when they have scheduled time to focus on something, be that work or play.

•    Don’t underestimate your child’s ability to precommit and follow through. Even young children can learn to use precommitments as long as they set the rules and know how to use a timer or some other binding system. •    Consumer skepticism is healthy. Understanding that companies are motivated to keep kids spending time watching or playing is an important part of teaching media literacy. •    Put the kids in charge. It’s only when kids practice monitoring their own behavior that they learn how to manage their own time and attention.

When one person takes out a phone at dinner, it acts as an external trigger. Soon, others are lost in their screens, at the expense of the conversation. Psychologists call this phenomenon “social contagion,” and researchers have found that it influences our behaviors, from drug use to overeating.

•    Distraction in social situations can keep us from being fully present with important people in our lives. Interruptions degrade our ability to form close social bonds. •    Block the spread of unhealthy behaviors. “Social antibodies” are ways groups protect themselves from harmful behaviors by making them taboo. •    Develop new social norms. We can tackle distraction among friends the same way we beat social smoking, by making it unacceptable to use devices in social situations. Prepare a few tactful phrases—like asking, “Is everything OK?”—to discourage phone usage among friends.

INTRODUCTION •    Chapter 1: Living the life you want requires not only doing the right things but also avoiding doing the wrong things. •    Chapter 2: Traction moves you toward what you really want while distraction moves you further away. Being indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do. PART 1: MASTER INTERNAL TRIGGERS •    Chapter 3: Motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. Find the root causes of distraction rather than proximate ones. •    Chapter 4: Learn to deal with discomfort rather than attempting to escape it with distraction. •    Chapter 5: Stop trying to actively suppress urges—this only makes them stronger. Instead, observe and allow them to dissolve. •    Chapter 6: Reimagine the internal trigger. Look for the negative emotion preceding the distraction, write it down, and pay attention to the negative sensation with curiosity rather than contempt. •    Chapter 7: Reimagine the task. Turn it into play by paying “foolish, even absurd” attention to it. Deliberately look for novelty. •    Chapter 8: Reimagine your temperament. Self-talk matters. Your willpower runs out only if you believe it does. Avoid labeling yourself as “easily distracted” or having an “addictive personality.” PART 2: MAKE TIME FOR TRACTION •    Chapter 9: Turn your values into time. Timebox your day by creating a schedule template. •    Chapter 10: Schedule time for yourself. Plan the inputs and the outcome will follow. •    Chapter 11: Schedule time for important relationships. Include household responsibilities as well as time for people you love. Put regular time on your schedule for friends. •    Chapter 12: Sync your schedule with stakeholders. PART 3: HACK BACK EXTERNAL TRIGGERS •    Chapter 13: Of each external trigger, ask: “Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it?” Does it lead to traction or distraction? •    Chapter 14: Defend your focus. Signal when you do not want to be interrupted. •    Chapter 15: To get fewer emails, send fewer emails. When you check email, tag each message with when it needs a reply and respond at a scheduled time. •    Chapter 16: When it comes to group chat, get in and out at scheduled times. Only involve who is necessary and don’t use it to think out loud. •    Chapter 17: Make it harder to call meetings. No agenda, no meeting. Meetings are for consensus building rather than problem solving. Leave devices outside the conference room except for one laptop. •    Chapter 18: Use distracting apps on your desktop rather than your phone. Organize apps and manage notifications. Turn on “Do Not Disturb.” •    Chapter 19: Turn off desktop notifications. Remove potential distractions from your workspace. •    Chapter 20: Save online articles in Pocket to read or listen to at a scheduled time. Use “multichannel multitasking.” •    Chapter 21: Use browser extensions that give you the benefits of social media without all the distractions. Links to other tools are at: NirAndFar.com/Indistractable. PART 4: PREVENT DISTRACTION WITH PACTS •    Chapter 22: The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought. Plan ahead for when you’re likely to get distracted. •    Chapter 23: Use effort pacts to make unwanted behaviors more difficult. •    Chapter 24: Use a price pact to make getting distracted expensive. •    Chapter 25: Use identity pacts as a precommitment to a self-image. Call yourself “indistractable.” PART 5: HOW TO MAKE YOUR WORKPLACE INDISTRACTABLE •    Chapter 26: An “always on” culture drives people crazy. •    Chapter 27: Tech overuse at work is a symptom of dysfunctional company culture. The root cause is a culture lacking “psychological safety.” •    Chapter 28: To create a culture that values doing focused work, start small and find ways to facilitate an open dialogue among colleagues about the problem. PART 6: HOW TO RAISE INDISTRACTABLE CHILDREN (AND WHY WE ALL NEED PSYCHOLOGICAL NUTRIENTS) •    Chapter 29: Find the root causes of why children get distracted. Teach them the four-part indistractable model. •    Chapter 30: Make sure children’s psychological needs are met. All people need to feel a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. If kids don’t get their needs met in the real world, they look to fulfill them online. •    Chapter 31: Teach children to timebox their schedule. Let them make time for activities they enjoy, including time online. •    Chapter 32: Work with your children to remove unhelpful external triggers. Make sure they know how to turn off distracting triggers, and don’t become a distracting external trigger yourself. •    Chapter 33: Help your kids make pacts and make sure they know managing distraction is their responsibility. Teach them that distraction is a solvable problem and that becoming indistractable is a lifelong skill. PART 7: HOW TO HAVE INDISTRACTABLE RELATIONSHIPS •    Chapter 34: When someone uses a device in a social setting, ask, “I see you’re on your phone. Is everything OK?” •    Chapter 35: Remove devices from your bedroom and have the internet automatically turn off at a specific time.

We have all spent many years building up a conditioned view of life. There is “me” and there is this “thing” out there that is either hurting me or pleasing me. We tend to run our whole life trying to avoid all that hurts or displeases us, noticing the objects, people, or situations that we think will give us pain or pleasure, avoiding one and pursuing the other. Without exception, we all do this. We remain separate from our life, looking at it, analyzing it, judging it, seeking to answer the questions, “What am I going to get out of it? Is it going to give me pleasure or comfort or should I run away from it?” We do this from morning until night. Underneath our nice, friendly facades there is great unease. If I were to scratch below the surface of anyone I would find fear, pain, and anxiety running amok. We all have ways to cover them up. We overeat, over-drink, overwork; we watch too much television. We are always doing something to cover up our basic existential anxiety. Some people live that way until the day they die. As the years go by, it gets worse and worse.
